## Restaurant Booking System:

You have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.

### MVP:

Your system must be able to:

* Allow bookings with different duration
* Allow either a customer or an admin to use the app
* Allow a user to register/login using email and password
* Allow customer to book a table at the restaurant for a particular time and date
* Allow customer to cancel/edit a reservation 
* Allow customer to see their past/future bookings and details
* Allow customer to see table availability based on 1) date, 2) time, and 3) booking duration

* Allow admin to make a reservation for a customer
* Allow admin to cancel/edit a reservation for a customer
* Allow admin to see past/future bookings, either DONE or PENDING
* Allow admin to see details of a DONE booking
* Allow admin to close a PENDING booking and pass the receipt
* Allow admin to see table availability based on 1) date, 2) time, and 3) booking duration

* Not allow double bookings

### Project Extensions:

* Allow admin to see last month's total income and reservations
* Allow admin to see how many days pass on average before the average customer comes back
* Allow admin to see a graph depicting bookings trend over time for both DONE and PENDING bookings
* Allow admin to see a graph with "peak times" for each hour of the day/each day of the week/each day of the month
* Allow admin to see a graph of customers ordered by frequency of visits
* Allow admin to see a graph of a given customer's preferred dishes
* Allow admin to see a graph with the most popular dishes

* Allow customer to live-chat with admin
* Allow customer to cancel/book a reservation by phone (react-native)
* Allow customer to see past bookings and details via phone
